# Air-Pollution-and-Mental-Health-
This project utilised an air pollution and mental health database which took into account  environmental statistics, self-reported wellbeing statistics, and cognitive test results from people in  Barcelona, Spain. 

Stress is a self-reported value on a scale of 1-10 in the given dataset. Air pollution can adversely affect the central nervous system, leading to mental health concerns such as stress and anxiety. Predicting stress levels based on environmental conditions can provide 
information useful to inform urban planning and policy decisions aimed at reducing air 
pollution and creating healthier environments. The aim of this analysis is to predict 
whether an individual living in Barcelona suffers from high or low stress levels using Sopport Vector Machines.
